# Cybersecurity Labs & Utilities 🛡️

A growing collection of Python-based tools and cybersecurity exercises built to demonstrate core concepts from network defense, threat detection, and security policy. Ideal for learners studying for CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications or pursuing cybersecurity education through programs like WGU’s BSCSIA.

## 🔢 What's Included

- 🔍 **Network Scanner** – Scan IP ranges and identify open ports
- 🔐 **Password Strength Checker** – Detect weak or predictable passwords
- ✉️ **Phishing Email Analyzer** – Flag suspicious headers and links
- 📄 **Log Parser** – Identify anomalies in system logs
- 🧪 **Malware Simulation (Safe)** – Demonstrate common attack behavior (harmless)
- 📘 **Security Policy Template** – A basic policy for small orgs or personal use
